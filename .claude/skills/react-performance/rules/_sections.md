# Sections

This file defines all sections, their ordering, impact levels, and descriptions.
The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.

Section 3 of the Vercel original — Server-Side Performance (`server-`) — is deliberately absent.
This project is a frontend-only Vite SPA: no server, no RSC, no API routes. See SKILL.md.

## 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (async)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Waterfalls are the #1 performance killer. Each sequential await adds full network latency. Eliminating them yields the largest gains.

## 2. Bundle Size Optimization (bundle)

**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Reducing initial bundle size improves Time to Interactive and Largest Contentful Paint.

## 3. Client-Side Browser APIs (client)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Description:** Efficient use of event listeners and client storage reduces redundant work on the main thread.

## 4. Re-render Optimization (rerender)

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Reducing unnecessary re-renders minimizes wasted computation and improves UI responsiveness.

## 5. Rendering Performance (rendering)

**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Optimizing the rendering process reduces the work the browser needs to do.

## 6. JavaScript Performance (js)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Description:** Micro-optimizations for hot paths can add up to meaningful improvements.

## 7. Advanced Patterns (advanced)

**Impact:** LOW  
**Description:** Advanced patterns for specific cases that require careful implementation.
